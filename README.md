### Chating – Responsive Landing Page (HTML & SCSS)
Chating Landing Page is a modern, responsive marketing website built with semantic HTML5 and structured SCSS architecture. It replicates a real-world SaaS-style landing page, providing a clean hero section, structured feature blocks, call-to-action areas, and a well-organized footer layout.

The project demonstrates modern frontend development best practices, focusing on:

**Clean architecture:** logical separation of layout sections (navbar, hero, features, footer) with structured and maintainable SCSS organization.

**Responsive design:** mobile-first implementation with scalable breakpoints to ensure seamless user experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

**Maintainable styling workflow:** use of SCSS for nesting, modular structure, and reusable styling patterns.

**Performance efficiency:** lightweight markup and optimized CSS output for fast rendering and smooth layout performance.

**UI consistency & visual hierarchy:** structured spacing, clear typography hierarchy, and reusable component patterns inspired by modern SaaS interfaces.

This landing page showcases a professional frontend workflow commonly used in production-ready marketing websites, emphasizing clean code structure, scalability, and responsive design principles.
